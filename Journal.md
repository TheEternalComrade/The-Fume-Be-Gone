I realllyyy want to get a 3d printer. It would be so nifty for hardware projects and fixing stuff and convenience and some other things I can't think of right now.

There's just one small problem...You see, there's a tendency for heating up things to cause nasty fumes to be emitted. To my great disappointment, this is also true for 3d printing. I plan on mostly(if not exclusively) printing in PLA, as it's all I can really afford. When doing research on this topic, I encountered many dismissive comments about the potential risks of printing with specificially PLA. While it may produce less of them, basically all filaments produce UFPs(ultra-fine particles) and VOCs(volatile organic compounds).

[(1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156368/)"UFPs can deposit in the distal lung regions (alveoli) and lung parenchyma and penetrate into the heart and bloodstream, which can cause significant damage to the respiratory system, cardiovascular system and all organs."
[(2)](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality) VOCs can cause reactions such as eye irritation, nose irritation, damage to the central nervous system, cancer, and interestingly, headaches. I've actually heard testimonials of people experiencing headaches from being too close to their printers, so I think proceeding with caution is a good idea.

In the interest of living a long and healthy life(and the same for my housemates)
